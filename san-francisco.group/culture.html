<h1>Culture</h1>
<p>We’re building an environment that is both technically and creatively inspiring. From tech-talks to artist-in-residence workshops, our vision is to educate through participation.</p>

<p>As part of the Rackspace San Francisco office, we’re able to utilize direct connections to <a href="people">industry leaders</a> who have experience building great companies. We also host contributors and specialists in: node.js, twisted python, cassandra, openstack, and many more open-source projects. </p>

<p>And if your mind desires to escape beyond just product, there will be unique activities for members. From learning how to tune a bike to volunteering in the community to karaoke sessions. Plus we have flavor, our kitchen is stocked with delicious snacks and Sriracha sauces. We even have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPfmNxKLDG4" target="_blank">two turntables and a microphone</a>.
</p>
<p>And of course, we also host many wonderful <a href="events">events</a>.</p>
