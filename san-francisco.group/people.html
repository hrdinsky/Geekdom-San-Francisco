<h2><a href="https://github.com/kordless" target="_blank">Kord Campbell</a></h2> 
<p>#loggly #splunk #evangelist</p>
<div class="expandable">
<p>In a given day you may find Kord evangelizing on variety of topics, including the bright, shiny future of cloud computing, crude developer-centric marketing tactics, and the importance of practicing digital detox at the most unseasonable of moments. Kord was sculpted into a battle hardened entrepreneur by way of several startups of little note, including an ancient dialup ISP called The Internet Shop, a distributed web crawler by the name of Grub, a smells-like-Flickr site named Zoto and, of course, Loggly.  Kord also served as Splunk's Chief Evangelist during the Cold War, but that's a story for another day.</p>
