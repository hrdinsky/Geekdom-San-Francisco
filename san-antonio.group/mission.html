              <p><strong>The power of Mentors.</strong> Teaching, training and workshops are a deep part of the daily fabric. Part of our membership is paying with your 'time'. <strong>You must give back 1 hour a week to work with individuals &amp; teams or give a workshop once a month to be a member.</strong> This ensures collaboration because the resources of other like-minded people are there to guide and teach when you need it.</p>

              <p><strong>The power of Membership.</strong> Geekdom is very low-cost to admitted members. Geekdom is about building technologists and entrepreneurs with the power of collaboration. <strong>Geekdom is not just about renting desks. This is our difference.</strong></p>

            <div class="pillar-description">
              <p><strong>The power of the Heart-Set.</strong> Geekdom promotes and trains the entrepreneurial Heart-set as much as the mind-set: permission to fail and the real role of risk as an opportunity. This cannot be taught at Harvard or any university to date. It has to happen in practice. No successful entrepreneur hasn’t failed numerous times. We believe passion guides developers and startups and they must work through what doesn’t work short term to be successful long term.</p>
